Homework #5 - Hard Assignment

Assigned: 10/28/17

Due: 11/4/17

I had a particulary tough time at first on this assignment as I wasn't yet solid at creating and manipulating HTML using JS or jQuery.

However, once I got my inspiration, I was able to work on this non-stop, challenging myself to incorporate as many features of the 
game show into mine. Despite not getting to finish all the features, it is a workable game that is very similar to the real show.

Features I will include in future versions:
- Questions progressively go from easy to hard, depending on the stage of the game
- A "Final Answer" pop-up when a question is selected to add more drama 
- Adding more money stages to the game to match the real game show
- Lifeline - call a friend. currently it gives the correct answer every time, but I want there be a random selection of incorrect answers
- LIfeline - ask the audience. Currently it gives a pre-made answer that will always be correct. I want there to be more trepedition 
   as the game gets to harder questions (or stages)

JavaScript Assignment 2
Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to
layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

Before You Begin

Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images
In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
Choose a game to build from your options below.
Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

Basic
Click Here to Watch the Demo.
You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

Advanced
Click Here to Watch the demo.
You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds,
display the next question -- do this without user input.
The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show
the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer.
Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading 
the page).
